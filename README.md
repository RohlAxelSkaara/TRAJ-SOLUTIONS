### Usage
When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows or MacOS. Then the user will input a sentence or two describing their problem. The website will try to find an existing article describing a solution to the users problem. If that is not possible the user will be prompted with the decision to contact support by either chat, e-mail or phone.

*When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows, MacOS, Linux or other operating systems. After selecting the appropriate OS, the website will show a table of questions with common problems PC-users may experience. After selecting the suitible question, a new table will show, with further questions fitting for the problem. This system of tables of questions will continue until the program can calculate a relevant solution to the users problem. The user will also have the option to choose between other options of support, including: 24/7 Over-the-phone helpdesk, 24/7 helpchat, or our "@HOME" homesupport service.

Over-the-phone helpdesk: 
Is a over the phone service, which allowes the user to directly speak to one of our operators. This service will be use full for those who cannot get realted help from our system, or have a hard time explaining their problem.

Helpchat support:
With helpchat support, the user is able to connect directly with one of our operators through a online chat. This service will be usefull for users whom can´t find a solution to their related problem, and may find it easier to contact us via a online chat.

@HOME homesupport service:
Our @HOME service allows our users to get the help they may need, at home. If the user´s problem cannot the resolved via our other services, a poerater can be ordered dirctly to the users home, where they can get their problem solved directy, either it is a software-, or hardware problem.


### Design

#### Project Detials

The target group of the website will be average computer users. Many people often run into easy resolvable IT issues. The goal of the website is to provide a quick and easy to use service to these users. The website will not store any critical information on its users and will therefor not need any advanced cyber security software. 

#### Userflow:
1. The user should be able to use the website either as a registered user or "guest". The website should be intuitive and easy for the user to use. The user will input his/her problem into the searchbar and will get suggestions on articles that will help the user resolve the problem. The software on the website will find the most relevent articles to the users problem based on word and sentence recognition in the users input. If the website cannot find any articles of relevence it will lead the user to the sites live support. 

2. The user should be able to log-on to the system and create one or more articles that will describe solutions to common IT problems.

#### Notable functions based on the company/developer needs:
1. The website will use simple software based on word and sentence recognition to find article based on user inputs. It will not use AI or any advanced algorithms as those solutions would be difficult and expensive to implement. 

2. The website will focus on simple design and an ease of use interface.
